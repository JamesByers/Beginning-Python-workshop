# BASIC DATA TYPES

x = 5               # creates an object
x==5                # evaluates to True
print type(x)       # check the type: int (not declared explicitly)
type(x)             # automatically prints
type(5)             # assigning it to a variable is not required

type(5.0)           # float
type('five')        # str
type(True)          # bool
